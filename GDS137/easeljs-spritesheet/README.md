# EaselJS: Spritesheet

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/createjs/pen/xmKgwV](https://codepen.io/createjs/pen/xmKgwV).

An example of defining a SpriteSheet, then displaying it using Sprite. This demo also shows playing named animations (jump and run), setting  animation speed, chaining animations, and using "gotoAndPlay()".

Click the stage to initialize a jump, which will continue back into the run when it is complete.
